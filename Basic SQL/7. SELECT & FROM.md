## The SQL command that will be used in every query you write: SELECT ... FROM ....
   - ***SELECT*** indicates which column(s) you want to be given the data for.
   - ***FROM*** specifies from which table(s) you want to select the columns. Notice the columns need to exist in this table.

If you want to be provided with the data from all columns in the table, you use "*", like so:

    SELECT * FROM orders

Note that using SELECT does not create a new table with these columns in the database, it just provides the data to you as the results, or output, of this command.
