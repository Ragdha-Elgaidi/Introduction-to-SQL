# The LIMIT statement
It is useful when you want to see just the first few rows of a table. This can be much faster for loading than if we load the entire dataset.

 ### The LIMIT command is always the very last part of a query. 
- An example of showing just the first 10 rows of the orders table with all of the columns might look like the following:

      SELECT *
      FROM orders
      LIMIT 10;
