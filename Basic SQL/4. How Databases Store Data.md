# A few key points about data stored in SQL databases:
   1. ***Data in databases is stored in tables that can be thought of just like Excel spreadsheets.***
      - For the most part, you can think of a database as a bunch of Excel spreadsheets. Each spreadsheet has rows and columns. Where each row holds data on a transaction, a person, a company, etc., while each column holds data pertaining to a particular aspect of one of the rows you care about like a name, location, a unique id, etc.
   2. ***All the data in the same column must match in terms of data type.***
      - An entire column is considered quantitative, discrete, or as some sort of string. This means if you have one row with a string in a particular column, the entire column might change to a text data type. This can be very bad if you want to do math with this column!
   3. ***Consistent column types are one of the main reasons working with databases is fast.***
       - Often databases hold a LOT of data. So, knowing that the columns are all of the same types of data means that obtaining data from a database can still be fast.
