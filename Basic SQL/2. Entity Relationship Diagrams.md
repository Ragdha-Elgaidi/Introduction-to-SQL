#  Entity-relationship diagram (ERD) 
It is a common way to view data in a database. 

## Ex:
 - These diagrams help you visualize the data you are analyzing including:
   - The names of the tables.
   - The columns in each table.
   - The way the tables work together.

You can think of each of the boxes below as a spreadsheet.

## What to Notice

- In the database there are five tables (essentially 5 spreadsheets):
    - web_events
    - accounts
    - orders
    - sales_reps
    - region

- You can think of each of these tables as an individual spreadsheet. Then the columns in each spreadsheet are listed below the table name.
#### For example:
 the region table has two columns: id and name. Alternatively, the web_events table has four columns.

### Note:
The "crow's foot" that connects the tables together shows us how the columns in one table relate to the columns in another table.
