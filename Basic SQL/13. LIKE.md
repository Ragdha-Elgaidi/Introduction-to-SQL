# The LIKE operator 
- It is extremely useful for working with text.
- You will use LIKE within a WHERE clause. 
- The LIKE operator is frequently used with %.
-  The % tells us that we might want any number of characters leading up to a particular set of characters or following a certain set of characters, as we saw with the google syntax above. 
-  Remember you will need to use single quotes for the text you pass to the LIKE operator because these lower and uppercase letters are not the same within the string. Searching for 'T' is not the same as searching for 't'.

##### Example:
       SELECT *
       FROM accounts
       WHERE website LIKE '%google%';
