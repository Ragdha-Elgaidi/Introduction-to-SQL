# The NOT operator
- It is an extremely useful operator for working with the previous two operators we introduced: IN and LIKE.
- By specifying NOT LIKE or NOT IN, we can grab all of the rows that do not meet particular criteria.

##### Query 1

      SELECT sales_rep_id, 
       name
      FROM accounts
      WHERE sales_rep_id NOT IN (321500,321570)
      ORDER BY sales_rep_id

##### Query 2

      SELECT *
      FROM accounts
      WHERE website NOT LIKE '%com%';
