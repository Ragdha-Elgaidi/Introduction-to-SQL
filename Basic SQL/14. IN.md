# The IN operator:
- It is useful for working with both numeric and text columns.
- This operator allows you to use an =, but for more than one item of that particular column. 
- We can check one, two, or many column values for which we want to pull data, but all within the same query.

### Expert Tip:
In most SQL environments, you can use single or double quotation marks
-and you may NEED to use double quotation marks if you have an apostrophe within the text you are attempting to pull.
##### Example:
    SELECT *
    FROM orders
    WHERE account_id IN (1001,1021);
