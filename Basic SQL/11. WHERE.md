the WHERE statement.
# Common symbols used in WHERE statements include:

  -  (greater than) > 

  -  (less than) < 

  -  (greater than or equal to) >=

  -  (less than or equal to) <=

  -  (equal to) = 

  -  (not equal to) != 
   
##### Example:
      SELECT *
      FROM orders
      WHERE account_id = 4251
      ORDER BY occurred_at
      LIMIT 1000;
# WHERE with Non-Numeric Data
The WHERE statement can also be used with non-numeric data. We can use the = and != operators here. You need to be sure to use single quotes (just be careful if you have quotes in the original text) with the text data, not double quotes.
