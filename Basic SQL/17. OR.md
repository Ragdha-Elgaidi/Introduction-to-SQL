 # OR operator
 - It can combine multiple statements. 
 - Each time you link a new statement with an OR, you will need to specify the column you are interested in looking at.
 - You may link as many statements as you would like to consider at the same time. 
 - This operator works with all of the operations we have seen so far including arithmetic operators (+, *, -, /), LIKE, IN, NOT, AND, and BETWEEN logic can all be linked together using the OR operator.
