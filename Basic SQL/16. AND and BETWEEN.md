# The AND operator 
- It is used within a WHERE statement to consider more than one logical clause at a time. 
- Each time you link a new statement with an AND, you will need to specify the column you are interested in looking at.
- You may link as many statements as you would like to consider at the same time. 
- This operator works with all of the operations we have seen so far including arithmetic operators (+, *, -, /). 
- LIKE, IN, and NOT logic can also be linked together using the AND operator.
# BETWEEN Operator
Sometimes we can make a cleaner statement using BETWEEN than we can use AND. 
Particularly this is true when we are using the same column for different parts of our AND statement. 

- Instead of writing :

      WHERE column >= 6 AND column <= 10

- we can instead write, equivalently:

       WHERE column BETWEEN 6 AND 10


- Query 1

      SELECT *
      FROM orders
      WHERE occurred_at >= '2016-04-01' AND occurred_at <= '2016-10-01'
      ORDER BY occurred_at

- Query 2

This query has been modified to properly include BETWEEN

    SELECT *
    FROM orders
    WHERE occurred_at BETWEEN '2016-04-01' AND '2016-10-01'
    ORDER BY occurred_at
