# Avoid Spaces in Table and Variable Names
It is common to use underscores and avoid spaces in column names. It is a bit annoying to work with spaces in SQL. In Postgres, if you have spaces in column or table names, you need to refer to these columns/tables with double quotes around them (Ex: FROM "Table Name" as opposed to FROM table_name). In other environments, you might see this as square brackets instead (Ex: FROM [Table Name]).

# Semicolons

Depending on your SQL environment, your query may need a semicolon at the end to execute. Other environments are more flexible in terms of this being a "requirement." It is considered best practice to put a semicolon at the end of each statement, which also allows you to run multiple queries at once if your environment allows this.
