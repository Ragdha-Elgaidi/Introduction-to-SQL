# Logical Operators include:
 1. **LIKE** This allows you to perform operations similar to using WHERE and =, but for cases when you might not know exactly what you are looking for.
 2. **IN** This allows you to perform operations similar to using WHERE and =, but for more than one condition.
 3. **NOT** This is used with IN and LIKE to select all of the rows NOT LIKE or NOT IN a certain condition.
 4. **AND** & BETWEEN These allow you to combine operations where all combined conditions must be true.
 5. **OR** This allows you to combine operations where at least one of the combined conditions must be true.
