# The key to SQL is understanding statements. A few statements include:
  - **CREATE TABLE** 
  It is a statement that creates a new table in a database.
  - **DROP TABLE**
  It is a statement that removes a table in a database.
  - **SELECT**
  It allows you to read data and display it. This is called a query.
