# GROUP BY
   - It can be used to aggregate data within subsets of the data. 
        ######  For example
        grouping for different accounts, different regions, or different sales representatives.
### Notes
 - Any column in the SELECT statement that is not within an aggregator must be in the GROUP BY clause.
 - The GROUP BY always goes between WHERE and ORDER BY.
 - it is worth noting that SQL evaluates the aggregations before the LIMIT clause. 
 - If you don’t group by any columns, you’ll get a 1-row result—no problem there.
 - If you group by a column with enough unique values that it exceeds the LIMIT number, 
   the aggregates will be calculated, and then some rows will simply be omitted from the results.

###### Query 1: Results in an error

        SELECT account_id,
               SUM(standard_qty) AS standard,
               SUM(gloss_qty) AS gloss,
               SUM(poster_qty) AS poster
       FROM orders

###### Query 2:

       SELECT account_id,
              SUM(standard_qty) AS standard,
              SUM(gloss_qty) AS gloss,
              SUM(poster_qty) AS poster
       FROM orders
       GROUP BY account_id
       ORDER BY account_id
### Notes
- You can GROUP BY multiple columns at once. This is often useful to aggregate across a number of different segments.
- The order of columns listed in the ORDER BY clause does make a difference. You are ordering the columns from left to right.
- The order of column names in your GROUP BY clause doesn’t matter—the results will be the same regardless.
-  If we run the same query and reverse the order in the GROUP BY clause, you can see we get the same results. As with ORDER BY, you can substitute numbers for column names in the GROUP BY clause. 
- It’s generally recommended to do this only when you’re grouping many columns, or if something else is causing the text in the GROUP BY clause to be excessively long.
- A reminder here that any column that is not within an aggregation must show up in your GROUP BY statement. If you forget, you will likely get an error. However, in the off chance that your query does work, you might not like the results!

##### Query 1:

      SELECT account_id,
             channel,
             COUNT(id) as events
      FROM web_events
      GROUP BY account_id, channel
      ORDER BY account_id, channel

##### Query 2:

      SELECT account_id,
             channel,
             COUNT(id) as events
      FROM web_events
      GROUP BY account_id, channel
      ORDER BY account_id, channel DESC
