# MIN & MAX
- they are aggregators that again ignore NULL values. 
- Functionally, MIN and MAX are similar to COUNT in that they can be used on non-numerical columns. 
- Depending on the column type, MIN will return the lowest number, earliest date, or non-numerical value as early in the alphabet as possible. 
- As you might suspect, MAX does the opposite—it returns the highest number, the latest date, or the non-numerical value closest alphabetically to “Z.”
