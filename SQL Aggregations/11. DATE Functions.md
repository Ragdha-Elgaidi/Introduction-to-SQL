# DATE Functions
- GROUPing BY a date column is not usually very useful in SQL, as these columns tend to have transaction data down to a second. 
- Keeping date information at such granular levels is both a blessing and a curse, as it gives really precise information (a blessing), but it makes grouping information together directly difficult (a curse).

##### Query 1:

       SELECT occurred_at,
              SUM(standard_qty) AS standard_qty_sum
       FROM orders
       GROUP BY occurred_at
       ORDER BY occurred_at

## DATE_TRUNC
It allows you to truncate your date to a particular part of your date-time column. 
Common truncations are day, month, and year. 

## DATE_PART
It can be useful for pulling a specific portion of a date,but notice pulling month or day of the week (dow) means that you are no longer keeping the years in order. Rather you are grouping for certain components regardless of which year they belonged in.

### NOTE:
You can reference the columns in your select statement in GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses with numbers that follow the order they appear in the select statement. For example

        SELECT standard_qty, COUNT(*)

        FROM orders

        GROUP BY 1 (this 1 refers to standard_qty since it is the first of the columns included in the select statement)

        ORDER BY 1 (this 1 refers to standard_qty since it is the first of the columns included in the select statement)
###### Query 1:

       SELECT occurred_at,
              SUM(standard_qty) AS standard_qty_sum
       FROM orders
       GROUP BY occurred_at
       ORDER BY occurred_at

###### Query 2:

       SELECT DATE_PART('dow',occurred_at) AS day_of_week,
              account_id,
              occurred_at,
              total
       FROM orders

###### Query 3:

       SELECT DATE_PART('dow',occurred_at) AS day_of_week,
              SUM(total) AS total_qty
       FROM orders
       GROUP BY 1
       ORDER BY 2
