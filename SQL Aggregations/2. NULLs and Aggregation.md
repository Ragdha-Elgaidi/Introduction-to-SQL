# NULLs
- they are a datatype that specifies where no data exists in SQL. 
- they are different than a zero - they are cells where data does not exist. 
- There are two common ways in which you are likely to encounter NULLs:
    - NULLs frequently occur when performing a LEFT or RIGHT JOIN. when some rows in the left table of a left join are not matched with rows in the right table, those rows will contain some NULL values in the result set.
    - NULLs can also occur from simply missing data in our database.
