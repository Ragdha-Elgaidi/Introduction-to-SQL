# HAVING 
- It is the “clean” way to filter a query that has been aggregated, but this is also commonly done using a subquery. 
- Essentially, any time you want to perform a WHERE on an element of your query that was created by an aggregate, you need to use HAVING instead.

##### Query 1:

       SELECT account_id,
              SUM(total_amt_usd) AS sum_total_amt_usd
       FROM orders
       GROUP BY 1
       ORDER BY 2 DESC

##### Query 2: Results in an Error

      SELECT account_id,
             SUM(total_amt_usd) AS sum_total_amt_usd
      FROM orders
      WHERE SUM(total_amt_usd) >= 250000
      GROUP BY 1
      ORDER BY 2 DESC

###### Query 3:

       SELECT account_id,
              SUM(total_amt_usd) AS sum_total_amt_usd
       FROM orders
       GROUP BY 1
       HAVING SUM(total_amt_usd) >= 250000

### Often there is confusion about the difference between WHERE and HAVING:
  - WHERE subsets the returned data based on a logical condition.
  - WHERE appears after the FROM, JOIN, and ON clauses, but before GROUP BY.
  - HAVING appears after the GROUP BY clause, but before the ORDER BY clause.
  - HAVING is like WHERE, but it works on logical statements involving aggregations.
