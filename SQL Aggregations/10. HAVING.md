# HAVING 
- It is the “clean” way to filter a query that has been aggregated, but this is also commonly done using a subquery. 
- Essentially, any time you want to perform a WHERE on an element of your query that was created by an aggregate, you need to use HAVING instead.

##### Query 1:

       SELECT account_id,
              SUM(total_amt_usd) AS sum_total_amt_usd
       FROM orders
       GROUP BY 1
       ORDER BY 2 DESC

##### Query 2: Results in an Error

      SELECT account_id,
             SUM(total_amt_usd) AS sum_total_amt_usd
      FROM orders
      WHERE SUM(total_amt_usd) >= 250000
      GROUP BY 1
      ORDER BY 2 DESC

###### Query 3:

       SELECT account_id,
              SUM(total_amt_usd) AS sum_total_amt_usd
       FROM orders
       GROUP BY 1
       HAVING SUM(total_amt_usd) >= 250000
