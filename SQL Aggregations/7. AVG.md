# AVG
 - Similar to other software AVG returns the mean of the data - that is the sum of all of the values in the column divided by the number of values in a column. 
 - This aggregate function again ignores the NULL values in both the numerator and the denominator.
#### Note
If you want to count NULLs as zero, you will need to use SUM and COUNT. However,
this is probably not a good idea if the NULL values truly just represent unknown values for a cell.

#### MEDIAN 

One quick note that a median might be a more appropriate measure of center for this data, 
but finding the median happens to be a pretty difficult 
thing to get using SQL alone 

##### Query 1

    SELECT AVG(standard_qty) AS standard_avg,
           AVG(gloss_qty) AS gloss_avg,
           AVG(poster_qty) AS poster_avg
    FROM orders
