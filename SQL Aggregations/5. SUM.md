# SUM
Unlike COUNT, you can only use SUM on numeric columns. 
However, SUM will ignore NULL values.

##### Aggregation Reminder

An important thing to remember: aggregators only aggregate vertically 
- the values of a column. 
- If you want to perform a calculation across rows, you would do this with simple arithmetic.
