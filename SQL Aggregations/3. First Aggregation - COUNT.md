# COUNT the Number of Rows in a Table
 Here is an example of finding all the rows in the accounts table.

    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM accounts;

But we could have just as easily chosen a column to drop into the aggregation function:

    SELECT COUNT(accounts.id)
    FROM accounts;

These two statements are equivalent
##### Query 1

    SELECT *
    FROM orders
    WHERE occurred_at >= '2016-12-01'
    AND occurred_at < '2017-01-01'

##### Query 2

    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM orders
    WHERE occurred_at >= '2016-12-01'
    AND occurred_at < '2017-01-01'

##### Query 3

    SELECT COUNT(*) AS order_count
    FROM orders
    WHERE occurred_at >= '2016-12-01'
    AND occurred_at < '2017-01-01'
