# DISTINCT
It is always used in SELECT statements, and it provides the unique rows for all columns written in the SELECT statement.
Therefore, you only use DISTINCT once in any particular SELECT statement.

#### code

    SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, column3
    FROM table1;

which would return the unique (or DISTINCT) rows across all three columns.

You would not write:

     SELECT DISTINCT column1, DISTINCT column2, DISTINCT column3
    FROM table1;

###### Note:
Itâ€™s worth noting that using DISTINCT, particularly in aggregations, can slow your queries down quite a bit.

###### Query 1:

     SELECT account_id,
            channel,
            COUNT(id) as events
     FROM web_events
     GROUP BY account_id, channel
     ORDER BY account_id, channel DESC

###### Query 2:

     SELECT account_id,
            channel
     FROM web_events
     GROUP BY account_id, channel
     ORDER BY account_id

###### Query 3:

    SELECT DISTINCT account_id,
           channel
    FROM web_events
    ORDER BY account_id
