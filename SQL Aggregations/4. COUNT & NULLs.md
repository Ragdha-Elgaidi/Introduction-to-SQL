# COUNT & NULLs
COUNT does not consider rows that have NULL values. 
Therefore, this can be useful for quickly identifying which rows have missing data. 

###### Query 1

    SELECT COUNT (*) AS account_count
    FROM accounts

###### Query 2

    SELECT COUNT (id) AS account_id_count
    FROM accounts

###### Query 3

    SELECT COUNT(primary_poc) AS account_primary_poc_count
    FROM accounts

###### Query 4

###### Example: there will not be any NULL values in the workspace.

    SELECT *
    FROM accounts
    WHERE primary_poc IS NULL
