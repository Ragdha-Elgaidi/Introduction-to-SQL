# The whole purpose of JOIN statements
It is to allow us to pull data from more than one table at a time.

###### With the addition of the JOIN statement to our toolkit, we will also be adding the ON statement.
We use ON clause to specify a JOIN condition which is a logical statement to combine the table in FROM and JOIN statements.

### Query1

    SELECT orders.*
    FROM orders

### Query2

    SELECT orders.*,
       accounts.*
    FROM orders 
    JOIN accounts
    ON orders.account_id = accounts.id;

###### Explanation:
the SELECT clause indicates which column(s) of data you'd like to see in the output (For Example, orders.* gives us all the columns in the orders table in the output). The FROM clause indicates the first table from which we're pulling data, and the JOIN indicates the second table. The ON clause specifies the column on which you'd like to merge the two tables together. Try running this query yourself below.
