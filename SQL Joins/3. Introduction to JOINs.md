# The whole purpose of JOIN statements
It is to allow us to pull data from more than one table at a time.

###### With the addition of the JOIN statement to our toolkit, we will also be adding the ON statement.
We use ON clause to specify a JOIN condition which is a logical statement to combine the table in FROM and JOIN statements.

### Query1

    SELECT orders.*
    FROM orders

### Query2

    SELECT orders.*,
       accounts.*
    FROM orders 
    JOIN accounts
    ON orders.account_id = accounts.id;
