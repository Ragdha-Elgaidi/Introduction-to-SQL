# The whole purpose of JOIN statements
It is to allow us to pull data from more than one table at a time.

###### With the addition of the JOIN statement to our toolkit, we will also be adding the ON statement.
We use ON clause to specify a JOIN condition which is a logical statement to combine the table in FROM and JOIN statements.

### Query1

    SELECT orders.*
    FROM orders

### Query2

    SELECT orders.*,
       accounts.*
    FROM orders 
    JOIN accounts
    ON orders.account_id = accounts.id;

###### Explanation:
the SELECT clause indicates which column(s) of data you'd like to see in the output (For Example, orders.* gives us all the columns in the orders table in the output). The FROM clause indicates the first table from which we're pulling data, and the JOIN indicates the second table. The ON clause specifies the column on which you'd like to merge the two tables together. 

## NOTE:
If we wanted to only pull individual elements from either the orders or accounts table, we can do this by using the exact same information in the FROM and ON statements. However, in your SELECT statement, you will need to know how to specify tables and columns in the SELECT statement:
    - The table name is always before the period.
    - The column you want from that table is always after the period.

###### For example
if we want to pull only the account name and the dates in which that account placed an order, but none of the other columns, we can do this with the following query:

    SELECT accounts.name, orders.occurred_at
    FROM orders
    JOIN accounts
    ON orders.account_id = accounts.id;

This query only pulls two columns, not all the information in these two tables. Alternatively, the below query pulls all the columns from both the accounts and orders table.

    SELECT *
    FROM orders
    JOIN accounts
    ON orders.account_id = accounts.id;

And the first query you ran pull all the information from only the orders table:

    SELECT orders.*
    FROM orders
    JOIN accounts
    ON orders.account_id = accounts.id;
