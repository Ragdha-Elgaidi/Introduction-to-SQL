-- Provide the name for each region for every order, as well as the account name and the unit price they paid (total_amt_usd/total) for the order.
-- However, you should only provide the results if the standard order quantity exceeds 100.
-- Your final table should have 3 columns: region name, account name, and unit price. 
-- In order to avoid a division by zero error, adding .01 to the denominator here is helpful total_amt_usd/(total+0.01).
