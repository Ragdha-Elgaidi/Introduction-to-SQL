# Primary Key (PK)
- It is a unique column in a particular table. This is the first column in each of our tables. 
- Here, those columns are all called id, but that doesn't necessarily have to be the name. 
- It is common that the primary key is the first column in our tables in most databases.
# Foreign Key (FK)
- It is a column in one table that is a primary key in a different table. 

    region_id
    account_id
    sales_rep_id

# Primary - Foreign Key Link 
(In the above image you can see that:)
   - The region_id is the foreign key.
   - The region_id is linked to id - this is the primary-foreign key link that connects these two tables.
   - The crow's foot shows that the FK can actually appear in many rows in the sales_reps table.
   - While the single line is telling us that the PK shows that id appears only once per row in this table.
