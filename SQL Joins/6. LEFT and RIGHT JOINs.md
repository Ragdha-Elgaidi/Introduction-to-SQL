# JOINs
Notice each of these new JOIN statements pulls all the same rows as an INNER JOIN, 
which you saw by just using JOIN, but they also potentially pull some additional rows.
##### Note
- If there is not matching information in the JOINed table, then you will have columns with empty cells.
- These empty cells introduce a new data type called NULL. 

##### Query1

     SELECT a.id, a.name, o.total
     FROM orders o
     LEFT JOIN accounts a
     ON o.account_id = a.id

##### Query2

     SELECT a.id, a.name, o.total
     FROM orders o
     RIGHT JOIN accounts a
     ON o.account_id = a.id
