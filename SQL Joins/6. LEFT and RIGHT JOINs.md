# JOINs
Notice each of these new JOIN statements pulls all the same rows as an INNER JOIN, 
which you saw by just using JOIN, but they also potentially pull some additional rows.
##### Note
- If there is not matching information in the JOINed table, then you will have columns with empty cells.
- These empty cells introduce a new data type called NULL. 

##### Query1

     SELECT a.id, a.name, o.total
     FROM orders o
     LEFT JOIN accounts a
     ON o.account_id = a.id

##### Query2

     SELECT a.id, a.name, o.total
     FROM orders o
     RIGHT JOIN accounts a
     ON o.account_id = a.id
##### Quick Note

You might see the SQL syntax of

     LEFT OUTER JOIN

OR

     RIGHT OUTER JOIN

These are the exact same commands as the LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN.
# OUTER JOINS

- The last type of join is a full outer join. This will return the inner join result set, as well as any unmatched rows from either of the two tables being joined.

- Again this returns rows that do not match one another from the two tables. The use cases for a full outer join are very rare.

##### Note
Similar to the above, you might see the language FULL OUTER JOIN, which is the same as OUTER JOIN.
