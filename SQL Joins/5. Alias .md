# Alias
- When we JOIN tables together, it is nice to give each table an alias.
- Frequently an alias is just the first letter of the table name. 
- You saw something similar for column names in the Arithmetic Operators concept.

#### Example:

    FROM tablename AS t1
    JOIN tablename2 AS t2

Before, you saw something like:

    SELECT col1 + col2 AS total, col3

Frequently, you might also see these statements without the AS statement. Each of the above could be written in the following way instead, and they would still produce the exact same results:

    FROM tablename t1
    JOIN tablename2 t2

and

    SELECT col1 + col2 total, col3

## Aliases for Columns in Resulting Table

- While aliasing tables is the most common use case.
- It can also be used to alias the columns selected to have the resulting table reflect a more readable name.

#### Example:

     Select t1.column1 aliasname, t2.column2 aliasname2
     FROM tablename AS t1
     JOIN tablename2 AS t2

- The alias name fields will be what shows up in the returned table instead of t1.column1 and t2.column2

- If you have two or more columns in your SELECT that have the same name after the
table name such as accounts.name and sales_reps.name you will need to alias them.
Otherwise it will only show one of the columns.
You can alias them like accounts.name AS AcountName, sales_rep.name AS SalesRepName

#### Quary:
     SELECT o.*, a.*
     FROM orders o
     JOIN accounts a
     ON o.account_id = a.id
