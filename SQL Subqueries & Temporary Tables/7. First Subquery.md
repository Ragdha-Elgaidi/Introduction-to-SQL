# First Subquery

    SELECT channel,
           AVG(event_count) AS avg_event_count
    FROM
    (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
            channel,
            count(*) as event_count
       FROM web_events
       GROUP BY 1,2
       ) sub
       GROUP BY 1
       ORDER BY 2 DESC


### You’ll notice the following order of operations.
- ***Build the Subquery:*** The aggregation of an existing table that you’d like to leverage as a part of the larger query.
- ***Run the Subquery:*** Because a subquery can stand independently, it’s important to run its content first to get a sense of whether this aggregation is the interim output you are expecting.
- ***Encapsulate and Name:*** Close this subquery off with parentheses and call it something. In this case, we called the subquery table ‘sub.’
- ***Test Again:*** Run a SELECT * within the larger query to determine if all syntax of the subquery is good to go.
- ***Build Outer Query:*** Develop the SELECT * clause as you see fit to solve the problem at hand, leveraging the subquery appropriately.
