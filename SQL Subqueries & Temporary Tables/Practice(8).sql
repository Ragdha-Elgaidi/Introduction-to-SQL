-- What is the lifetime average amount spent in terms of total_amt_usd for the top 10 total spending accounts?

-- First, we just want to find the top 10 accounts in terms of highest total_amt_usd.

SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_spent
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.id, a.name
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Now, we just want the average of these 10 amounts.

      GROUP BY a.id, a.name
