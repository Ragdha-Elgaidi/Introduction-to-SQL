# A subquery 
It is a query within a query.
   - As a reminder, a query has both SELECT and FROM clauses to signify what you want to extract from a table and what table youâ€™d like to pull data from. A query that includes subquery, as a result, has multiple SELECT and FROM clauses.
    The subquery that sits nested inside a larger query is called ***an INNER QUERY***. This inner query can be fully executed on its own and often is run independently before when trying to troubleshoot bugs in your code.
### Example:
     SELECT product_id,
         name,
         price
     FROM db.product
     Where price > (SELECT AVG(price)
                    FROM db.product)
