# Subqueries: Dependencies
### Simple Subquery
 The inner subquery is completely independent of the larger query.

    WITH dept_average AS 
      (SELECT dept, AVG(salary) AS avg_dept_salary
       FROM employee
       GROUP BY employee.dept
      )
    SELECT E.eid, E.ename, D.avg_dept_salary
    FROM employee E
    JOIN dept.average D
    ON E.dept = D.dept
    WHERE E.salary > D.avg_dept_salary

### Correlated Subquery
The inner subquery is dependent on the larger query

    SELECT employee_id,
           name
    FROM employees_db emp
    WHERE salary > 
          (SELECT AVG(salary)
           FROM employees_db
           WHERE department = emp.department
          );
###### Note
- The second concept to consider before writing any code is the dependency of your subquery to the larger query.
A subquery can either be simple or correlated. 
In my experience, it’s better to keep subqueries simple to increase readability for other users that might leverage
your code to run or adjust.

- However, sometimes, it’s slick to include a correlated subquery, 
specifically when the value of the inner query is dependent on a value outputted from the main query 
(e.g., the filter statement constantly changes). In the example below, 
you’ll notice that the value of the inner query -- average GPA -- keeps adjusting depending on the university the student goes to. THAT is a great use case for the correlated subquery.

##### Query
     SELECT first_name, last_name, GPA, university
     FROM student_db outer_db
     WHERE GPA >
                    (SELECT AVG(GPA)
                     FROM student_db
                     WHERE university = outer_db.university);
