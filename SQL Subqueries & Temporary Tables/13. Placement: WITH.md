# Placement: WITH
- When a user wants to create a version of an existing table to be used in a larger query (e.g., aggregate daily prices to an average price table).
- It is advantageous for readability purposes.

#### Sample 'With' subquery

    WITH average_price as
    ( SELECT brand_id, AVG(product_price) as brand_avg_price
      FROM product_records
    ),
    SELECT a.brand_id, a.total_brand_sales, b.brand_avg_price
    FROM brand_table a
    JOIN average_price b
    ON b.brand_id = a.brand_id
    ORDER BY a.total_brand_sales desc;
