# Placement: Inline
- Use Case for Inline Subquery
    - It is a very similar use case to ‘With’ subqueries.
    - Inline subqueries create a “pseudo table” that aggregates or manipulates an existing table to beused in a larger query.
    - The disadvantage of the inline subquery is that it is not easy to read.

#### Inline Query

        SELECT dept_name,
               max_gpa
        FROM department_db x
             (SELECT dept_id
                     MAX(gpa) as max_gpa
              FROM students
              GROUP BY dept_id
              )y
        WHERE x.dept_id = y.dept_id
        ORDER BY dept_name;
