# Subquery Strategy
- Before diving headfirst into building a subquery, consider the workflow below. Strong SQL users walk through the following before ever writing a line of code:
    - Determine if a subquery is needed (or a join/aggregation function will suffice).
    - If a subquery is needed, determine where you’ll need to place it.
    - Run the subquery as an independent query first: is the output what you expect?
    - Call it something! If you are working with With or Inline subquery, you’ll most certainly need to name it.
    - Run the entire query -- both the inner query and outer query.
