# when  do you need to use a subquery?
You need to use a subquery when you have the need to manipulate an existing table to “pseudo-create” a table that 
is then used as a part of a larger query. In the examples below, 
existing tables cannot be joined together to solve the problem at hand. Instead,
an existing table needs to be manipulated, massaged,
or aggregated in some way to then join to another table in the dataset to answer the posed questions
#### Note:
   Creating an average price temporary table to then identify customer orders where items exceed
   the average price within a department(as use of Subquery)
   
###### Query  
     SELECT product_id,
            name,
            price
     FROM db.product
     Where price > (SELECT AVG(price)
                   FROM db.product)
