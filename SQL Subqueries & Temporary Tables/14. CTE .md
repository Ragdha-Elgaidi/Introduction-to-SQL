# CTE
- It stands for Common Table Expression. 
- A Common Table Expression in SQL allows you to define a temporary result, such as a table, to then be referenced in a later part of the query.
- CTEs are more readable.
- CTEs are more efficient, as the tables aren't recreated with each subquery portion
