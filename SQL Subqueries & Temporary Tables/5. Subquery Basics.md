Fundamentals to Know about Subqueries:
- Subqueries must be fully placed inside parentheses.
- Subqueries must be fully independent and can be executed on their own
- Subqueries have two components to consider:
  - Where it’s placed
  - Dependencies with the outer/larger query

#### A caveat with subqueries being independent:

- In almost all cases, subqueries are fully independent.
- They are "interim”/temp tables that can be fully executed on their own. 
- However, there is an exception. When a subquery, typically in the form of a nested or 
inline subquery, is correlated to its outer query, it cannot run independently. 
- This is most certainly an edge case since correlated subqueries are rarely 
implemented compared to standalone, simple subqueries.

## Placement:
- There are four places where subqueries can be inserted within a larger query:
    - With
    - Nested
    - Inline
    - Scalar

## Dependencies:
A subquery can be dependent on the outer query or independent of the outer query.
