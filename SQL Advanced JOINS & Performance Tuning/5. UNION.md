# Appending Data via UNION
### UNION Use Case
  - The UNION operator is used to combine the result sets of 2 or more SELECT statements.
  -  It removes duplicate rows between the various SELECT statements.
  - Each SELECT statement within the UNION must have the same number of fields in the result sets with similar data types.
    Typically, the use case for leveraging the UNION command in SQL is when a user wants to pull together distinct values of specified columns that are spread across multiple tables. For example, a chef wants to pull together the ingredients and respective aisle across three separate meals that are maintained within different tables.

###### Details of UNION
   - There must be the same number of expressions in both SELECT statements.
   - The corresponding expressions must have the same data type in the SELECT statements.
   - For example:
       - Expression1 must be the same data type in both the first and second SELECT statement.
###### Tip
  -  UNION removes duplicate rows.
  -  UNION ALL does not remove duplicate rows.
    
# Appending Data via UNION Demonstration
- SQL's two strict rules for appending data:
   - Both tables must have the same number of columns.
   - Those columns must have the same data types in the same order as the first table.

- A common misconception is that column names have to be the same. Column names,
in fact, don't need to be the same to append two tables but you will find that they typically are.

    CREATE VIEW web_events_2
    AS (SELECT * FROM web_events)

    SELECT *
    FROM web_events
    UNION
    SELECT *
    FROM web_events_2

## Pretreating Tables before doing a UNION

    CREATE VIEW web_events_2
    AS (SELECT * FROM web_events)

    SELECT *
    FROM web_events
    WHERE channel = 'facebook'
    UNION ALL
    SELECT *
    FROM web_events_2

## Performing Operations on a Combined Dataset

    CREATE VIEW web_events_2
    AS (SELECT * FROM web_events)

    SELECT channel,
           COUNT(*) AS sessions
    FROM (
          SELECT *
          FROM web_events
          UNION ALL
          SELECT *
          FROM web_events_2
         ) web_events
    GROUP BY 1
    ORDER BY 2 DESC

##### use of union in real world:
   - When you want to determine all reasons students are late. Currently,   each late reason is maintained within tables corresponding to the grade the student is in.
