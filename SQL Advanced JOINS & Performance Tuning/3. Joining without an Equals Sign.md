 ### Tip

- If you recall from earlier lessons on joins, the join clause is evaluated before the where clause 
 filtering in the join clause will eliminate rows before they are joined, while filtering in the WHERE clause will leave those rows in and produce some nulls.

##### Query1

    SELECT orders.id,
           orders.occurred_at  AS order_date,
           events.*
    FROM   orders
    LEFT JOIN web_events events
           ON events.account_id = orders.account_id
          AND events.occurred_at = orders.occurred_at
    WHERE  DATE_TRUNC('month', orders.occurred_at)=
           (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(orders.occurred_at)) FROM orders)
    ORDER BY orders.occurred_at, orders.occurred_at

##### Query2

    SELECT accounts.name as account_name,
           accounts.primary_poc as poc_name,
           sales_reps.name as sales_rep_name
    FROM accounts
    LEFT JOIN sales_reps
    ON accounts.sales_rep_id = sales_reps.id
    AND accounts.primary_poc < sales_reps.name
