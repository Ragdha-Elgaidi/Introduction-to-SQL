# Window Functions in Real-world Applications
- They are sometimes confusing to figure out. When exactly do you use them? When are they appropriate over
aggregate functions? There are two use cases that I’ve experienced where window functions are particularly helpful.
   - When you want to measure trends or changes over rows or records in your data.
   - When you want to rank a column for outreach or prioritization.

- A few cases where you’d have these needs are described below:
    - Measuring change over time:
        -  Has the average price of airline tickets gone up this year?
        - What’s the best way to keep the running total orders of customers?
     - The ranking used for outreach prioritization:
        -  Use a combination of factors to rank companies most likely to need a loan.
