Scenarios for using LAG and LEAD functions

   - You can use LAG and LEAD functions whenever you are trying to compare the values in adjacent rows or rows that are offset by a certain number.

##### Example 1: 
You have a sales dataset with the following data and need to compare how the market segments fare against each other on profits earned.
Market Segment 	Profits earned by each market segment

|A |	$550|
|--|------|
|B |	$500|
|C |	$670|
|D |	$730|
|E |	$982|

#### Example 2: 
You have an inventory dataset with the following data and need to compare the number of days elapsed between each subsequent order placed for Item A.
Inventory 	Order_id 	Dates when orders were placed

|Item A |	001 |	11/2/2017|
|--------|------|-----------|
|Item A |	002 |	11/5/2017|
|Item A |	003 |	11/8/2017|
|Item A |	004 |	11/15/2017|
|Item A |	005 |	11/28/2017|

As you can see, these are useful data analysis tools that you can use for more complex analysis!
