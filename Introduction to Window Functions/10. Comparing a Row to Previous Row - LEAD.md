# LEAD function

- Purpose: 
    - Return the value from the row following the current row in the table.

## Step 1:

Let’s first look at the inner query and see what this creates.
```sql
SELECT     account_id,
           SUM(standard_qty) AS standard_sum
FROM       orders
GROUP BY   1
```
#### What you see after running this SQL code:
   The query sums the standard_qty amounts for each account_id to give the standard paper each account has purchased over all time. E.g., account_id 2951 has purchased 8181 units of standard paper.
    Notice that the results are not ordered by account_id or standard_qty.

## Step 2:

We start building the outer query, and name the inner query as sub.
```sql
SELECT account_id,
       standard_sum   
FROM   (
        SELECT   account_id,
                 SUM(standard_qty) AS standard_sum
        FROM     orders
        GROUP BY 1
       ) sub
```
This will produce the same table as above, but sets us up for the next part.
## Step 3 (Part A):

We add the Window Function (OVER BY standard_sum) in the outer query that will create a result set ordered in ascending order of the standard_sum column.
```sql
SELECT account_id,
       standard_sum,
       LEAD(standard_sum) OVER (ORDER BY standard_sum) AS lead
FROM   (
        SELECT   account_id,
                 SUM(standard_qty) AS standard_sum
        FROM     orders
        GROUP BY 1
       ) sub
```
This ordered column will set us up for the other part of the Window Function (see below).

## Step 3 (Part B):

The LEAD function in the Window Function statement creates a new column called lead as part of the outer query: LEAD(standard_sum) OVER (ORDER BY standard_sum) AS lead

This new column named lead uses the values from standard_sum (in the ordered table from Step 3 (Part A)). Each row’s value in lead is pulled from the row after it. E.g., for account_id 1901, the value in lead will come from the row following it (i.e., for account_id 3371). Since the value is 79, the value in lead for account_id 1901 will be 79. For account_id 3371, the value in lead will be pulled from the following row (i.e., account_id 1961), which will be 102. This goes on for each row in the table.
```sql
SELECT account_id,
       standard_sum,
       LEAD(standard_sum) OVER (ORDER BY standard_sum) AS lead
FROM   (
        SELECT   account_id,
                 SUM(standard_qty) AS standard_sum
        FROM     orders
        GROUP BY 1
       ) sub
```

## Step 4: 
To compare the values between the rows, we need to use both columns (standard_sum and lag). We add a column named lead_difference, which subtracts the value in standard_sum from lead for each row in the table: LEAD(standard_sum) OVER (ORDER BY standard_sum) - standard_sum AS lead_difference
```sql
SELECT account_id,
       standard_sum,
       LEAD(standard_sum) OVER (ORDER BY standard_sum) AS lead,
       LEAD(standard_sum) OVER (ORDER BY standard_sum) - standard_sum AS lead_difference
FROM (
SELECT account_id,
       SUM(standard_qty) AS standard_sum
       FROM orders 
       GROUP BY 1
     ) sub
```
Each value in lead_difference is comparing the row values between the 2 columns (standard_sum and lead). E.g., for account_id 1901, the value in lead_difference will compare the value 0 (standard_sum for account_id 1901) with 79 (lead for account_id 1901) resulting in 79. This goes on for each row in the table.
