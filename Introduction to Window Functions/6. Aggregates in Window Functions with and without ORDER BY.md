# Aggregates in Window Functions with and without ORDER BY
```sql
SELECT id,
       account_id,
       standard_qty,
       DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at) AS month,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month',occurred_at)) AS dense_rank,
       SUM(standard_qty) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month',occurred_at)) AS sum_std_qty,
       COUNT(standard_qty) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month',occurred_at)) AS count_std_qty,
       AVG(standard_qty) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month',occurred_at)) AS avg_std_qty,
       MIN(standard_qty) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month',occurred_at)) AS min_std_qty,
       MAX(standard_qty) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month',occurred_at)) AS max_std_qty
FROM orders
```
- Now remove ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month',occurred_at) in each line of the query that contains it in the SQL Explorer below. Evaluate your new query, compare it to the results in the SQL Explorer above, and answer the subsequent quiz questions.
The easiest way to think about this - leaving the ORDER BY out is equivalent to "ordering" in a way that all rows in the partition are "equal" to each other. Indeed, you can get the same effect by explicitly adding the ORDER BY clause like this:
ORDER BY 0 (or "order by" any constant expression), or even, more emphatically, ORDER BY NULL. 
```sql
SELECT id,
       account_id,
       standard_qty,
       DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at) AS month,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY 0) AS dense_rank,
       SUM(standard_qty) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY 0) AS sum_std_qty,
       COUNT(standard_qty) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY 0) AS count_std_qty,
       AVG(standard_qty) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY 0) AS avg_std_qty,
       MIN(standard_qty) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY 0) AS min_std_qty,
       MAX(standard_qty) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY 0) AS max_std_qty
FROM orders
```
