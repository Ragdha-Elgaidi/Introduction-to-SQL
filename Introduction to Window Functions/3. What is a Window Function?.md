# Window Function:
- A window function is a calculation across a set of rows in a table that are somehow related to the current row.
-  This means we’re typically:
   - Calculating running totals that incorporate the current row or,
   - Ranking records across rows, inclusive of the current one
- A window function is similar to aggregate functions combined with group by clauses but have one key difference: 
    - Window functions retain the total number of rows between the input table and the output table (or result). 
    - Behind the scenes, the window function is able to access more than just the current row of the query result.

- When window functions are used, you’ll notice new column names like the following:
   - Average running price
   - Running total orders
   - Running sum sales
   - Rank
   - Percentile


```sql
SELECT order_id,
       order_date,
       SUM(order_total) OVER
          (PARTITION BY month(order_date) ORDER BY order_date)
          AS running_monthly_sales
FROM amazon_db
WHERE order_date>'2017-01-01';
```
- The following terms will be covered over  broken into three types of window functions: 
core, ranking, and advanced.  
   - ***Partition by:*** A subclause of the OVER clause. Similar to GROUP BY.
   - ***Over:*** Typically precedes the partition by that signals what to “GROUP BY”.
   - ***Aggregates:*** Aggregate functions that are used in window functions, too (e.g., sum, count, avg).
   - ***Row_number():*** Ranking function where each row gets a different number.
   - ***Rank():*** Ranking function where a row could get the same rank if they have the same value.
   - ***Dense_rank():*** Ranking function similar to rank() but ranks are not skipped with ties.
   - ***Aliases:*** Shorthand that can be used if there are several window functions in one query.
   - ***Percentiles:*** Defines what percentile a value falls into over the entire table.
   - ***Lag/Lead:*** Calculating differences between rows’ values.
