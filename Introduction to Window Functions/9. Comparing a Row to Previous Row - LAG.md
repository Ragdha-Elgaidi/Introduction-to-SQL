# LAG function

- Purpose
    - It returns the value from a previous row to the current row in the table.

## Step 1:
Let’s first look at the inner query and see what this creates.

```sql
SELECT     account_id, SUM(standard_qty) AS standard_sum
FROM       orders
GROUP BY   1
```
##### What you see after running this SQL code:
The query sums the standard_qty amounts for each account_id to give the standard paper each account has purchased overall time. E.g., account_id 2951 has purchased 8181 units of standard paper.
   - Notice that the results are not ordered by account_id or standard_qty.

## Step 2:

We start building the outer query, and name the inner query as sub.
```sql
SELECT account_id, standard_sum   
FROM   (
        SELECT   account_id, SUM(standard_qty) AS standard_sum
        FROM     orders
        GROUP BY 1
       ) sub
```
This still returns the same table you see above.
## Step 3 (Part A):
We add the Window Function OVER (ORDER BY standard_sum) in the outer query that will create a result set in ascending order based on the standard_sum column.
```sql
SELECT account_id, 
       standard_sum,
       LAG(standard_sum) OVER (ORDER BY standard_sum) AS lag
FROM   (
        SELECT   account_id, SUM(standard_qty) AS standard_sum
        FROM     orders
        GROUP BY 1
       ) sub
```
This ordered column will set us up for the other part of the Window Function (see below).

## Step 3 (Part B):

The LAG function creates a new column called lag as part of the outer query: LAG(standard_sum) OVER (ORDER BY standard_sum) AS lag. This new column named lag uses the values from the ordered standard_sum (Part A within Step 3).
```sql
SELECT account_id,
       standard_sum,
       LAG(standard_sum) OVER (ORDER BY standard_sum) AS lag
FROM   (
        SELECT   account_id,
                 SUM(standard_qty) AS standard_sum
        FROM     orders
        GROUP BY 1
       ) sub
```
Each row’s value in lag is pulled from the previous row. E.g., for account_id 1901, the value in lag will come from the previous row. However, since there is no previous row to pull from, the value in lag for account_id 1901 will be NULL. For account_id 3371, the value in lag will be pulled from the previous row (i.e., account_id 1901), which will be 0. This goes on for each row in the table.

## Step 4:
To compare the values between the rows, we need to use both columns (standard_sum and lag). We add a new column named lag_difference, which subtracts the lag value from the value in standard_sum for each row in the table:
standard_sum - LAG(standard_sum) OVER (ORDER BY standard_sum) AS lag_difference
```sql
SELECT account_id,
       standard_sum,
       LAG(standard_sum) OVER (ORDER BY standard_sum) AS lag,
       standard_sum - LAG(standard_sum) OVER (ORDER BY standard_sum) AS lag_difference
FROM (
       SELECT account_id,
       SUM(standard_qty) AS standard_sum
       FROM orders 
       GROUP BY 1
      ) sub
```
Each value in lag_difference is comparing the row values between the 2 columns (standard_sum and lag). E.g., since the value for lag in the case of account_id 1901 is NULL, the value in lag_difference for account_id 1901 will be NULL. However, for account_id 3371, the value in lag_difference will compare the value 79 (standard_sum for account_id 3371) with 0 (lag for account_id 3371) resulting in 79. This goes on for each row in the table.

Query1
```sql
SELECT account_id,
       standard_sum,
       LAG(standard_sum) OVER(ORDER BY standard_sum) AS lag,
       LEAD(standard_sum) OVER (ORDER BY standard_sum) AS lead
FROM (
       SELECT account_id,
              SUM(standard_qty) AS standard_sum
       FROM orders
       GROUP BY 1
) sub
```
Query2
```sql
SELECT account_id,
       standard_sum,
       LAG(standard_sum) OVER(ORDER BY standard_sum) AS lag,
       LEAD(standard_sum) OVER (ORDER BY standard_sum) AS lead,
       standard_sum - LAG(standard_sum) OVER (ORDER BY standard_sum) AS lag_difference,
       LEAD(standard_sum) OVER (ORDER BY standard_sum) - standard_sum AS lead_difference
FROM (
       SELECT account_id,
              SUM(standard_qty) AS standard_sum
       FROM orders
       GROUP BY 1
) sub
```
