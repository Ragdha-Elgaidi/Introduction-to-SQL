# Aliases Use Case
- If you are planning to write multiple window functions that leverage the same PARTITION BY, OVER, and ORDER BY in a single query, leveraging aliases will help tighten your syntax.
#### Details of Aliases
   - A monthly_window alias function is defined at the end of the query in the WINDOW clause.
   - It is then called on each time an aggregate function is used within the SELECT clause.
 
```sql
SELECT order_id,
       order_total,
       order_price,
       SUM(order_total) OVER monthly_window AS running_monthly_sales,
       COUNT(order_id) OVER monthly_window AS running_monthly orders,
       AVG(order_price) OVER monthly_window AS average_monthly_price
FROM   amazon_sales_db
WHERE  order_date < '2017-01-01'
WINDOW monthly_window AS
       (PARTITION BY month(order_date) ORDER BY order_date);
```
