# Group By vs. Window Functions
- Similarities 
    - Both groups by/aggregation queries and window functions serve the same use case. 
     - Synthesizing information over time and often grouped by a column (e.g., a region, month, customer group, etc.)
- Differences
    - The difference between group by/aggregation queries and window functions is simple. 
    - The output of window functions retains all individual records whereas the group by/aggregation queries condense or collapse information.
- Key Notes
    - You can’t use window functions and standard aggregations in the same query. More specifically, you can’t include window functions in a GROUP BY clause.
     - Feel free to use as many window functions as you’d like in a single query. E.g., if you’d like to have an average, sum, and count aggregate function that captures three metrics’ running totals, go for it.

```sql
SELECT order_id,
       order_total,
       order_price,
       SUM(order_total) OVER
           (PARTITION BY month(order_date) ORDER BY order_date) AS running_monthly_sales,
       COUNT(order_id) OVER
           (PARTITION BY month(order_date) ORDER BY order_date) AS running_monthly orders,
       AVG(order_price) OVER
           (PARTITION BY month(order_date) ORDER BY order_date) AS average_monthly_price
FROM  amazon_sales_db
WHERE order_date < '2017-01-01';
```
