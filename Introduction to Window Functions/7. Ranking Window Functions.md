# Ranking Window Functions
- There are three types of ranking functions that serve the same use case: how to take a column and rank its values.
-  The choice of which ranking function to use is up to the SQL user, often created in conjunction with someone on a customer or business team.
    - **Row_number():** Ranking is distinct amongst records even with ties in what the table is ranked against.
    - **Rank():** Ranking is the same amongst tied values and ranks skip for subsequent values.
    - **Dense_rank():** Ranking is the same amongst tied values and ranks do not skip for subsequent values.

       date_time
