##### Use Case

If there are multiple columns that have a combination of null and non-null values and the user needs to extract the first non-null value, he/she can use the coalesce function.

***COALESCE*** is a command that helps you deal with null values. Now before using COALESCE, take a step back and think through how’d you like to deal with missing values in the first place.

## The three methods below are the most common ways to deal with null values in SQL:
- ***Coalesce:*** Allows you to return the first non-null value across a set of columns in a slick, single command. This is a good approach only if a single column’s value needs to be extracted whilst the rest are null.
- ***Drop records:*** Sometimes, if there are null values in records at all, analysts can decide to drop the row entirely. This is not favorable, as it removes data. Data is precious. Think about the reason those values are null. Does it make sense to use COALESCE, drop records, and conduct an imputation.
- ***Imputation:*** Outside of the COALESCE use case, you may want to impute missing values. If so, think about the problem you are trying to solve, and impute accordingly. Perhaps you’d like to be conversative so you take the MIN of that column or the 25th percentile value. Classic imputation values are often the median or mean value of the column.
