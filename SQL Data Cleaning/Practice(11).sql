-- then the last letter of their first name (lowercase), the first letter of their last name (lowercase), 
-- the last letter of their last name (lowercase), the number of letters in their first name,
-- the number of letters in their last name, 
-- and then the name of the company they are working with, all capitalized with no spaces.
