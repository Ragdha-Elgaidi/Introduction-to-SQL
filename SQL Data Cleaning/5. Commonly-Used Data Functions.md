## The following set of commonly-used data functions
 - Left/Right/Substr: Used to extract information typically when all information resides in a single column
 - Concat: Used commonly when two or more pieces of information can be used as a unique identifier
 - Cast: Used when data types default to a specific type (e.g., most commonly STRING) and need to be assigned to the appropriate data type to run computations

##### Note
they are handy when extracting and converting information in a raw dataset.
