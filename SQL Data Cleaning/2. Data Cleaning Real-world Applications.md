# By definition, data cleaning 
- It is the task of cleaning up raw data to make it usable and ready for analysis.
##### Note:
- Almost always, your data will not be ready for you to run an analysis.
    - Your data could all be lumped together in a single column, and you need to parse it to extract useful information.
    - Your data could all default to string data types, and you need to cast each column appropriately to run computations.
    - Your data could have un-standardized units of currency, and you need to normalize the column to ensure you are comparing equally across records.

- In my experience, there hasn’t been a day that goes by without some sort of data cleaning. 
- In fact, data scientists often joke that 80% of their time is spent preparing the data and only 20% is spent building models.

## Relevant Definitions:
#### Normalization: 
Standardizing or “cleaning up a column” by transforming it in some way to make it ready for analysis.
###### A few normalization techniques are below:
  - Adjusting a column that includes multiple currencies to one common currency
  - Adjusting the varied distribution of a column value by transforming it into a z-score
  - Converting all price into a common metric (e.g., price per ounce)
