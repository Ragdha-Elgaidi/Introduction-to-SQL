###### Use Case

When there is a single column that holds so much information, and the user needs to identify where a piece of information is. The location of the information is typically then used to consistently extract this information across all records.

#### Syntax for STRPOS
- ***STRPOS:*** Converts a value of any type into a specific, different data type

      STRPOS(string, substring)

###### Use Case

When the raw data types are unsuitable for analyses. The most common occurrence is when the raw data types all default to strings, and the user has to cast each column to the appropriate data type.
