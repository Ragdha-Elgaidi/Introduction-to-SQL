# The key steps to consider when going about your data cleaning task include the following:
##### What data do you need?:
-  Review what data you need to run an analysis and solve the problem at hand.
##### What data do you have?: 
- Take stock of not only the information you have in your dataset today but what data types those fields are. Do these align with your data needs?
##### How will you clean your data?: 
- Build a game plan of how you’ll convert the data you currently have to the data you need. What types of actions and data cleaning techniques will you have to apply? Do you have the skills you need to go from the current to future state?
##### How will you analyze your data?:
-  Now, it’s game time! How do you run an effective analysis? Build an approach for analysis, as well. And visualize your plan to solve the problem. Finally, remember to question “so what?” at the end of your results, which will help drive recommendations for your organization.
##### Note:
- It’s inadvisable to dive into executing a problem immediately.
- In fact, I recommend taking a step back to think through a strategy before ever writing a line of code. This approach goes for data cleaning, as well.
